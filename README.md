- 👋 Hell, I’m Mohamed Adel ELshiemy.
- 👀 I am interested in Digital IC Design (FPGA and ASIC Physical Design) and verification Flows.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Senior R&D Engineer in Digital IC Design and Verification track at Nile University, and I'm a master's degree candidate in the microelectronic system design (MSD) program.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on topics such as Digital IC Design, FPGA Prototyping, ASIC Physical Design, Verification, as well as Analog and Mixed Signal design. If you are interested in these areas, let’s connect to share knowledge and expertise.
  
- I'm enthusiastic about digital IC & ASIC design and looking forward to gaining more knowledge and experience.
- My particular interest is in the following areas of digital IC design:
- Verilog, System Verilog, VHDL, ASIC Design, RTL Design, synthesis, formal verification, "DFT" Design for testability, "STA" static timing analysis, floor planning, Power Planning, Boundary Cell Insertion, "PNR" placement and route, Digital implementation Layout, CTS, DRC, CDC, FPGA, LVS, EMIR, Sign off, VCS simulator, Spyglass (linting), Synopsys StarRC, Synopsys Prime Time, Modelsim, Vivado, Synopsys DC and ICC2 tools, Mentor Graphics Calibre Tool, TSMC, NanGate, and UMC PDKs.
